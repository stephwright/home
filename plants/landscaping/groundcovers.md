### Backyard under trees:

**Pachysandra**  
Pachysandra flanks an irregular bluestone pathway leading to an Asian-style gate with pergola. The shade-loving evergreen never needs cutting. Hard to zone 4, it grows up to 10 inches tall and in spring blooms with white or pink spikes.

### Side yard
**Roman Chamomile**  
Roman chamomile creates a pretty, low-maintenance lawn that releases an apple fragrance with every step. Plants prefer a sunny location but will grow in part shade. You can mow this groundcover regularly or to remove spent flowers.

**Miniature Brass Buttons (under fruit trees)**  
For heavy traffic, miniature brass buttons (Leptinella gruveri) is the plant of choice. A combination of above and below ground runners combine to create a thick mat that can even withstand car traffic up to twice a day. It thrives in the shade.

**Corsican mint (Mentha requienii)**  
Thrives in shade, exudes a minty smell when trod upon, and is edible.

### Back yard
**Dutch clover (Trifolium repens)**  
Dutch clover is a familiar face in meadows and lawns and actually makes a terrific lawn replacement. The deep green plants withstand normal foot traffic, but aren’t an ideal choice for a heavy traffic area, like a play area beneath a swing set. The small plants boast heat and drought tolerance and stand up to repeated mowing with ease. Newly developed micro-clovers are smaller and designed to blend in with turf grasses better. Dutch clover is hardy in Zones 3 to 9 and isn’t damaged by dog urine. Plants flower heaviest during a small window, but frequent mowing can keep flowers in check.

**Blue Star Creeper (Laurentia fluviatilis)**  
Has tiny green foliage, bear up to heavy foot traffic.
