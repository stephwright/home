# Home is where...

I'm always looking for ways to show folks how GitHub can be used and how it's NOT just a platform for coders.

This repo is an example of how it can be used to track information for the home.

* [Plants](plants/) is where I'm keeping track of our project to re-landscape our yard. :seedling: :herb: :sunflower: :apple: :honeybee:
* [Maint](maint/) is where I'm keeping track of general maintenance of the home. :house_with_garden: :wrench: :hammer: :nut_and_bolt: :pencil: :pushpin:

Others will be added as I think of them.

Feel free to explore... you can't break it.
